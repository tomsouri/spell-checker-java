Spell checker

Console application for checking and correcting of misspelled words in a text
using a lexicon of known word forms.
If it find a misspelled word (unknown word form), tries to find the closest
known forms.
Interactive mode allows adding new word forms to the lexicon.

To run the program:
in the directory src, run command
`make run`
which downloads the MorfFlex file, which is used as a dictionary of known word
forms, as well as a e-book, which can be used for testing the usage. It also
builds the the *.class files and runs the program with 11Gb of RAM memory for
the process.

After starting the program, you have to wait several minutes (~ 12 minutes for
the first run, ~ 5 for the next runs) until the lexicon is built/loaded.

Then you get to an interactive shell with several commands:
help: Print this help
        Example usage: help
exit: Exits the program
        Example usage: exit
check: Check the given file and report unknown words in the second file.
        Example usage: check inputFilename outputFilename
correct: Correct a given file and report unknown words and the suggestions to the second
        Example usage: correct inputFilename outputFilename
add: Adds the given form to the lexicon of known words.
        Example usage: add novéslovíčko
alter: Suggest alternations of the given form. Find `n` closest known words.
        Example usage: alter divnoslovo 5
has: Checks, whether a given form is in the lexion or not.
        Example usage: has předivnéslovo

Instead of running the program interactively, you can feed it with some input
commands, if they are correctly separated by newlines.
